# Neuromatch Machine Learning Project
This repository contains my implementation for the machine learning project in the Neuromatch summer school 2024. This project aims to 
analyze and predict social behavioral states of mice using sequences of behavior extracted from pose estimation data. 

In this notebook, I performed keypoint-MoSeq pipeline including Autoregressive Hidden Markov Model (AR-HMM) 
to obtain sequences of mouse social behavioral states like investigation, attack, and mounting.
